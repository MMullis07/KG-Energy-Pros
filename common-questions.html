                        <hr>
                        <p>Motors by their very design are inefficient when demanding power from your energy grid. This is why air conditioner and refrigeration manufacturers have started building this technology into their systems and are able to charge you thousands of dollars more.
                                But, even by building the product into their units, it still doesn&rsquo;t handle the individual customer&rsquo;s inefficient electrical system setup. We have tested our product to high efficient air conditioners and were still able to lower their energy usage 10%. And these results were on the MOST EXPENSIVE unit in a brand new home! The property owner couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes.</p>
                        <p>By installing this device to your property, you can handle the inefficiencies directly for your property.</p>
                        <p>Motors in your home (such as your Central Air Conditioner, Heat Pump or Pool Pump) are currently wasting energy. This means you are already paying the power company more of your hard earned dollars than you need to EVERY month! You can put a stop to this today.</p>
                        <p>By capturing and recycling (otherwise lost energy/watts) and releasing it back to your motor when needed, you can dramatically lower your energy bills. This recycling process reduces the amount of heat on the wires and the motors in your home. Reducing this heat (kilowatts) will lower your electricity bill and lengthen the life of the motors in your home.</p>
                        <p>Every property in the USA currently has some of the following inductive motors that can be made more energy efficient without paying out the nose for a new system/appliance.</p>
                        <p>These include, but are not limited to: Central Air Conditioner, Heat Pump, Pool Pump, Refrigerator, Freezer, Washer, Dryer, Ceiling Fans ,T-12 Fluorescent Lighting Ballast, etc.</p>
                        <p>Commercial Properties pay thousands of dollars every month on energy costs for refrigeration, air conditioning, and expensive motor driven equipment. Imagine the savings you can bring to these businesses. By helping them reduce operating costs, you boost the economy. As they are able to operate more successfully, they can expand and create more jobs, as well as provide a better product or service to our society.</p>
                        <p>Utility companies have been using this technology to make their energy grids more efficient for decades. The KG-2000 uses this very same technology. By recycling the otherwise wasted energy on your property back to your motors/appliances, you have less kilowatt usage from your power company, which means LOWER ELECTRICITY BILLS for you!</p>
                        <p>And no we aren’t talking about eliminating “power factor penalties” for homeowners because homeowners aren’t given power factor penalties and are only billed for their usage. We are talking about making the motors and appliances in your home more efficient. By installing a new energy efficient refrigerator in your home, you use less energy. The ONLY way for your power company to tell whether you have an old refrigerator or a new one is by it’s usage. By making your home more energy efficient (by lowering the actual kilowatts the motors/appliances in your home or business uses), you are billed less, it’s as simple as that.</p>

                                <h3>Transformer</h3>
                                <p>This is an inductive load on the energy grid similar to the motors/appliances on your property (whether it’s a home or business).</p>

                                <h3>High Voltage Pole Mount Capacitor Bank</h3>
                                <p>This is what your power company is using to make their grids more efficient so they can increase profits and service more customers using the same equipment. With the KG-2000, you can reduce demand and legally lower electricity bills simply by making the motors/appliance in your home or business more energy efficient.</p>
                                <p>Your electric company has been using this technology for decades to make their systems more energy efficient. Why would your power company spend tens of thousands of dollars adding this technology to their grids if this method doesn’t work?</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-sm-3">

                        <h3>BECAUSE THIS TECHNOLOGY DOES WORK!</h3>
                        <p>Don&rsquo;t take my word for it, though. Look around your city/neighborhood at the power poles, for approximate every 50 transformers, you will notice this technology being used.</p>
                        <h3>Is the KG-2000 UL Listed and CuL listed?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, our products have all been thoroughly safety tested and meet the safety requirements by UL. In fact, our facility is randomly inspected several times a year to ensure you are receiving top notch safe equipment.</p>
                        <h3>Why is the KG-2000 So Inexpensive? (Compared to 20-25 years of Energy Savings)</h3>
                        <p>TWe are a family owned and operated manufacturing business. We proudly manufacture our quality MADE IN USA. By doing so, we keep our costs low and pass along the savings to you.</p>
                        <h3>Is this product a Surge Protector or Energy Saver?</h3>
                        <p>Yes & Yes- it&rsquo;s both!  It&rsquo;s the only surge protector on the planet that ALSO lowers your electric bill. Should your home or business get hit by a power surge or brownout, this product will shield your property and self sacrifice itself to ensure your motors/appliances are safe.</p>
                        <h3>Does the Electric Saver Operate Properly if I have Solar?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, this product helps your property’s motors become more energy efficient, this includes any power inverters you have on your solar system. When your motors/appliances/equipment (A/C, Heat Pump, Washer/Dryer, Refrigerator, Freezers, Water Pumps, etc.) are more efficient, they will require less energy. This will help your solar panel system be able to provide more benefits for you and your property. If you are selling electricity back to the utility provider, this will lower your usage so you can put more money in your pocket.</p>
                        <h3>How Many Electric Savers do I Need?</h3>
                        <p>Usually, a home needs 1 unit. Average homes across the USA (2000 square feet or less) need 1-KG-2000. The KG-2000 works up to 200 amps. If you are unsure, check your panel box. If your main breaker is 200 amps or less, you will need only 1 unit.</p>
                        <p>If you have a large property with multiple air conditioners, pool pumps, elevators, motor driven equipment, etc. call us, we can help you find what is best for your particular property.</p>
                        <h3>How long is the Warranty on the Electric Saver Device?</h3>
                        <p>Our guarantee is simply this: If you Don't  want the electric box any more for any reason simply call us and we’ll come out and pick it up from your house free of charge. No Monthly Contracts or commitments, it either saves you money and you keep it or it doesn't and you return it. </p>
                        <h3>Features of Electric Saver Products</h3>
                        <p>Designed to help make your home or business more energy efficient. We do this by recycling energy that is normally lost in your electrical system. By making your motors and appliances (such as your A/C, Refrigerator, Washer/Dryer) more energy efficient we can help you lower your electricity bills.</p>
                        <p>Energy Star recently reported that heating and cooling accounts for 40-60% of your power bill. That&rsquo;s HALF of your bill.</p>
                        <p>By making the motors in your home more efficient they run cooler and this increases the life of the motors and appliances in your home as well. This product also works as a whole house surge protector. It will safeguard your home&rsquo;s expensive motors against power surges (up to 2000 joules) and brownouts.</p>
